# tkinter-mines
This is my version of a cult classic game implemented entirely in python using Tkinter. This was 
meant only as a way for me to familiarise myself with Tkinter and is not going to be maintained or
updated further unless I decide to.

# Rules
Standard rules. Number tiles have the number of mines/bombs adjacent to it, mine tiles are an instant
game ender, blank tiles are not adjacent to any mines and generate connected tiles which are not mines.

# Win condition
To win, the board should be cleared and the mines should be flagged. If a mine tile is revealed you lose
the game instantly.

# Controls
Left click to reveal a tile, right click to flag a tile.
